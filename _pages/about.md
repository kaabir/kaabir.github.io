Hi! I am **Syed Kaabir Ali**. I am a doctoral candidate affiliated with the [Active Cell Matter Lab](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/research/biophys/equipe-19/?lang=en) and [Cilia Biology and Neurogenesis](https://www.ibens.bio.ens.psl.eu/spip.php?rubrique6&lang=fr) at the [√âcole normale sup√©rieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/). I am advised by Dr. [Julie Plastino](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/laboratory/directory/?lang=en&id=927), Dr. [Nathalie Delghyr](https://www.ibens.bio.ens.psl.eu/spip.php?rubrique6&lang=fr) and Dr. [Ayako Yamada](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0t5xxJMAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao). Prior to my doctoral studies, I received M.S. degree with a specialization in Microfluidics from [PSL University](https://microfluidics-master.fr/) in 2021, and the B.Tech degree in mechatronics engineering from [Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University](http://ipu.ac.in/usict/Researchusict.php) in 2018.

Currently, my research investigates the role of actin in shaping the nuclear architecture during ependymal cell differentiation. My work combines aspects of mechanotransduction, developmental biology, and microfluidics. I am particularly passionate about developing innovative technologies and integrating diverse tools to study the fundamental processes governing living systems. 

My research aims to uncover novel insights into the implications of mechanical regulation in cell fate, cellular organization, and function. This interdisciplinary approach provides a unique perspective on neurodevelopmental processes.

 <blockquote>
In this article we introduce an original microfluidic concept for constraint-free confinement of individual giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) in microchambers with a dynamically exchangeable outer medium. This technically simple method offers an ideal platform to study the spatio-temporal response of reconstituted phospholipid bilayer membranes and/or synthetic cell studies subjected to dynamic micro-environments.

[Actin-based deformations of the nucleus control multiciliated ependymal cell differentiation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.13.562225v2.abstract)

<blockquote>
Ependymal cells (ECs) are multiciliated cells which generate motile cilia-powered flows that are essential for the brain. This study reveals an important role of actin-based mechanical inputs to the nucleus as controlling factors in cell differentiation.  Our findings also demonstrate that nuclear deformation regulates retinoblastoma protein (pRB) phosphorylation/degradation. This protein controls the G1-to-S transition in cycling cells, but also activates master regulators of EC differentiation.
