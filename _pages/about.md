Hi! I am Syed Kaabir Ali. I am a doctoral candidate at the [Active Cell Matter Lab](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/research/biophys/equipe-19/?lang=en) at [√âcole normale sup√©rieure](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/). I am advised by Dr. [Julie Plastino](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/), Dr. [Nathalie Delghyr](https://www.ibens.bio.ens.psl.eu/spip.php?rubrique6&lang=fr) and Dr. [Ayako Yamada](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0t5xxJMAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao). Prior to my doctoral research career, I received the M.S. degree with a specialization in Microfluidics [PSL University](https://microfluidics-master.fr/) in 2021, and the B.Tech degree in mechatronics engineering from [Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University](http://ipu.ac.in/usict/Researchusict.php) in 2018.

Currently, my research investigates the role of actin in shaping nuclear architecture during ependymal cell differentiation. My work combines aspects of mechanotransduction, developmental biology, and microfluidics. I am particularly passionate about developing innovative technologies and integrating diverse tools to study the fundamental processes governing living systems. 

By integrating multiple disciplines, my research aims to uncover novel insights into the implications of mechanical regulation in cell fate, cellular organization, and function. This interdisciplinary approach provides a unique perspective on neurodevelopmental processes and related disorders.
